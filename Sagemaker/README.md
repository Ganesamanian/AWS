# Project Title

End-to-End Machine Learning with Amazon SageMaker

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the process of building, training, and fine-tuning a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using Amazon SageMaker on an open-source advertising dataset from Kaggle. The project includes detailed code explanations and steps to reproduce the results.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

- AWS account with SageMaker access
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (list them here)
- Bitbucket repository for this project
- Kaggle dataset can be seen in the data folder

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. **Clone the Repository**
   

2. **Configure AWS Credentials**
   Set up your AWS credentials and configuration for SageMaker. You can follow the instructions provided in the "End-to-End Machine Learning with Amazon SageMaker" PDF.

3. **Download the Dataset**
   Download the advertising dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory (provide instructions).

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
   Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the project and follow the step-by-step instructions for building, training, and fine-tuning the SVM model.

5. **Review the PDF Document**
   Refer to the "End-to-End Machine Learning with Amazon SageMaker" PDF for detailed code explanations, insights, and results.

## Results

Describe the key results and findings from the project. Include any visualizations, metrics, or model performance details.

## Acknowledgments

Mention any open-source libraries, tools, or resources that were used during the project. Give credit to the Kaggle dataset source and any external references.
